There are three different ways to do testing:

* two makefile targets: "nodetest" & "qtjsruntimetest"
* one webserving test: "webodf/tests/tests.html"

All three use the central file "tests.js". This file checks what runtime it is in,
and depending on that enables different tests.

All tests are written with classes implementing the interface core.UnitTest.
There can be sync and async tests.

Some tests expect to be run with a DOM document and use an empty div in it.
They need to get that div in the setUp() method by calling core.UnitTest.provideTestAreaDiv,
and should release it in the tearDown() method by calling core.UnitTest.cleanupTestAreaDiv.

TODO: each test case should be ideally run in a completely fresh setup, not using a random setup
by reusing the DOM and the global variables from the previous tests
(defending that with "but it's fuzzying tests!" is just a nice try ;) )
